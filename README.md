# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_WhiteWineData
A thorough study on the variables and its impact on the prediction of the quality of White wine data through Exploratory Data Analysis. 
The White Wine EDA project has resulted in me being skilled in using R for exploratory data analysis. I now know all the
libraries involved like ggplot2,dplyr, GGally, etc . I started with implementing basic functions like dim, str,names, head to
understand the structure and nature of white wine dataset which was assigned to explore. I further learnt to preprocess the
data through refining the dataset by omitting NA observations and subsetting the data through elimination of unwanted
variables. I also applied advance functions like summary, groupby, ggpairs and quantile ranges. Now i can confidently
create plots such as scatterplots, boxplots, histograms etc..I can also work on the Clarity of the plots and can highlight
White Wine EDA them through transperency, limiting the axes, jitter, and facet wrapping. I learnt a great deal about modelling in R. Finally i now know how to build and craft a project in R through R markdown(Rmd).
I found the Mulitvariate section quite challenging as i found it hard to determine the strucuture of plots. Here I needed to
build and also in determine which variables should be included and how to build inferences from the plot. I devoted alot of
time in gaining valuable insights and also in inter relating the variables. I made this difficult process a easy one by
examining the variables of interest obtained in bivariate section and focussing more on these variables in mulitvariate
analysis to draw significant conclusions.
I used effective visualization to determine significant relationships and confirming the same through correlations observed
between the variables. It was a fun learning experience and an eager process when trying to analyze the same set of
variables under different circumstances and drawing new significant information at each and every stage.
Success came in due course while evaluating particular relationships with multiple R tools. It seemed repetitive at that
time, because a lot of the insights were the same using different chart types and analysis tools. There are reasons which
added value to my skillset and mainly that there may be new insights when the data is displayed differently, and the other
reason is that it gave me the opportunity to practice all of the functions that I had learned during the course.
During data preprocessing stage, i just had vivid thoughts about significant variables that i will come across in future
analysis. I found it astonishing in the beginning to note alcohol being more inofrmative and significant variable than pH.
Later upon multiple analysis, i gained more knowledge and insights about why the idenfied significant variables playa vital
role in quality of white wine.
Finally, to understand and perform a perfect analysis i would like to dig deeper into the white wine making process and see
if i can include additional variables which might have been left out and that can interest me in my analysis. This will further
help in overcoming the model building process and generate a good predicitve model for this dataset. I also want to spend
more time on model re-specification by transforming the variables. After finalising and keying down the transformations
through regression i want to get the validation done before finalising on a Model to work for.
I have definitely increased my thought process and reasoning abilities in concluding my results in better way. In this way i
can work on any dataset now and perform Exploratory Data Analysis. I will keep working on different datasets in future to
keep improving as a Data analyst.
